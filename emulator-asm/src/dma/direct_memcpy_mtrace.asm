#
# memcpy_mtrace - Optimized version with memory tracing and actual copy
#
# This function performs three main tasks:
# 1. Encodes memcpy metadata (offsets, counts, flags) using fast_dma_encode
# 2. Records memory trace (pre-values and src data for verification/rollback)
# 3. Performs the actual memory copy from src to dst (with overlap handling)
#
# REGISTER USAGE:
# Uses general-purpose registers: rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rdi, rsi, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13
# Does NOT use XMM registers (caller doesn't need to save them)
# Preserves callee-saved registers (rbx, r12, r13 saved/restored in wrapper)
#
# PARAMETERS (NON System V AMD64 ABI):
#   rdi -> rbx = dst (u64)              - Destination address
#   rsi -> rax = src (u64)              - Source address
#   rdx -> count (usize)                - Number of bytes to copy
#   [r12 + r13*8] = trace_ptr (u64*)    - Pointer to memory trace buffer (input/output)
#
# RETURN VALUE:
#   RAX = Number of 64-bit words written to trace buffer
#
# MEMORY TRACE FORMAT (written to trace buffer sequentially):
#   [0]      = Encoded metadata (64-bit value with offsets, counts, flags)
#   [1]      = Pre-write value at aligned(dst) IF pre_count > 0
#   [1 or 2] = Post-write value at aligned(dst+count) IF post_count > 0
#   [...]    = All aligned qwords from aligned(src) to aligned(src+count)
#
# The trace buffer captures:
# - Original destination values (for undo/verification)
# - Source data (for verification)
# - Metadata needed to reconstruct the operation
#
# MEMORY COPY BEHAVIOR:
# - Handles overlapping src/dst correctly (like memmove)
# - For non-overlapping: optimized copy using pre_count/loop_count/post_count
# - For overlapping: backward byte-by-byte copy to avoid corruption
#
# PERFORMANCE:
# - Encoding: ~15-20 cycles (function call to fast_dma_encode, table lookup)
# - Trace writes: ~4 cycles per qword write
# - Src data copy to trace: ~1.5-2 cycles per qword (rep movsq)
# - Final memcpy (non-overlap): ~1.5-2 cycles per qword (rep movsq aligned)
# - Final memcpy (overlap): ~100-150 cycles overhead + ~4-5 cycles per byte (std/rep movsb/cld)
#
# SIDE EFFECTS:
# - Modifies memory at dst (count bytes)
# - Modifies trace buffer (variable size depending on pre/post counts)
# - Preserves direction flag (cld called after any std)

# Performance estimate (Modern x86-64, L1 cache hits):
#
# NON-OVERLAPPING FORWARD COPY PATH:
# - fast_dma_encode call:           ~15-20 cycles (function call + table lookup)
# - Write encoding to trace:        ~4 cycles
# - Pre-value trace (conditional):  ~12 cycles (if pre_count > 0)
# - Post-value trace (conditional): ~12 cycles (if post_count > 0)
# - Source data to trace:           ~1.5-2 cycles per qword (rep movsq)
# - Pre-bytes copy:                 ~3-5 cycles per byte (if pre_count > 0, max 7 bytes)
# - Aligned qwords copy:            ~1.5-2 cycles per qword (rep movsq, main data)
# - Post-bytes copy:                ~3-5 cycles per byte (if post_count > 0, max 7 bytes)
# - Function overhead:              ~10 cycles (push/pop, branches, return)
#
# TOTAL (best case, aligned, no pre/post):
#   ~30 cycles base + ~2 cycles per qword (trace + copy)
#
# TOTAL (typical case, some alignment):
#   ~50 cycles base + ~2 cycles per qword + ~4 cycles per pre/post byte
#
# OVERLAPPING BACKWARD COPY PATH:
# - Same trace overhead:            ~30-50 cycles
# - std instruction:                ~20-50 cycles (serializing, causes pipeline flush)
# - Backward byte copy:             ~3-5 cycles per byte (rep movsb backward)
# - cld instruction:                ~20-50 cycles (serializing, causes pipeline flush)
#
# TOTAL (overlap, worst case):
#   ~100-150 cycles base + ~4-5 cycles per byte
#
# NOTES:
# - Assumes L1 cache hits for all memory accesses
# - rep movsq/movsb performance varies by microarchitecture
# - Actual cycles may vary ±20% depending on CPU model and memory alignment
# - Fast path (aligned, no overlap) is ~2-3x faster than overlap path

# Mark stack as non-executable (required by modern linkers)
